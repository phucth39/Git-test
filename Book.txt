Python
Python is another language that is gaining wide acceptance and popularity. And
there are multiple socket.io server implementations for Python.
The frst we look at is gevent-socket.io (https://github.com/abourget/geventsocketio), which works with any WSGI-based web frameworks. So if you are using
any framework such as Pyramid, Pylons, Flask, and Django, this will work for you.
The only dependencies are gevent and gevent-websocket.
